# LangtonsAnt
An excuse to brush up on all the changes up to Java 11 for someone that hasn't touched it for eons.

The goal is to solve the Langton's Ant Turing problem somewhat elegantly, and possibly forcing the use of the newer Java constructs. At least one thing will be done with Lambda expressions, whether it needs them or not!
